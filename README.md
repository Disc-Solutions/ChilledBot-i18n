# ChilledBot Internationalization
Contribute to ChilledBot by translating it into new languages!
Simply fork and modify the project, then make a pull request.  
Make sure the language is available in this list: https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales

## Automatic Validation
All pull requests are automatically validated to ensure:
- ✅ Valid JSON syntax
- ✅ All keys from `en.json` are present in your translation
- ⚠️ Extra keys (not in `en.json`) will show warnings but won't fail the validation

The validation will post a comment on your PR with the results!
